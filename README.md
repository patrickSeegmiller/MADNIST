MNIST Done Wrong
 
MNIST serves as a de facto "Hello World!" in the realm of machine learning, so it's inclusion here as anything other than a miniscule practice project is likely to raise an eyebrow or two.

My hope, in the least, is that your expectations are subverted. The goal here is to approach the MNIST datasets in a manner that is both non-intuitive but still interesting, educational, entertaining, and perhaps even a little bit useful (in the same minimalist-utilitarian sense that a standard MNIST classifier is "useful)".

To get an idea of what I mean by this, you should check out the bad.art.ipynb file to see how I used RNNs to generate the second half of the MNIST images from the first, and then see (very soon) how to do it well using a GAN.

:D
